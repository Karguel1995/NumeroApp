## Technologies :technologist:
Technologies used in this project:
- JavaScript
- React Native

## Open project on your phone

1. Open your terminal and then type

$ git clone https://github.com/Karguel1995/NumeroApp-mobile-version.git

This clones the repo

2. cd into the new folder and type

$ npm install

This installs the required dependencies

3. To run the React project.
$ npm start

4. Install "Expo Go" on your phone

5. Open the app on your phone 
<br/>
üçé On your iPhone or iPad, open the default Apple "Camera" app and scan the QR code you see in the terminal or in Expo Dev Tools.
<br/>
ü§ñ On your Android device, press "Scan QR Code" on the "Projects" tab of the Expo Go app and scan the QR code you see in the terminal or in Expo Dev Tools.

### Is the app not loading on your device?
First, make sure that you are on the same wifi network on your computer and your device.
If it still doesn't work, it may be due to the router configuration ‚Äî this is common for public networks. You can work around this by choosing the "Tunnel" connection type in Expo Dev Tools, then scanning the QR code again.

<br />
üê¢
Using the "Tunnel" connection type will make app reloads considerably slower than on "LAN" or "Local", so it's best to avoid tunnel when possible. You may want to install a simulator/emulator to speed up development if "Tunnel" is required for accessing your machine from another device on your network.
